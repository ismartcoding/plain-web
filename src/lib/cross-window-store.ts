/**
 * Pinia store factory that automatically mirrors a declared subset of state
 * across all windows/tabs of the same app via BroadcastChannel.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   export const useMyStore = defineCrossWindowStore<MyState>('my', {
 *     state: () => ({ ... } as MyState),
 *   }, {
 *     syncKeys: ['counter', 'audioPlaying'],
 *   })
 *
 * Semantics:
 *   - Only the keys listed in `syncKeys` are broadcast. Everything else stays
 *     per-window (uploads, lightbox, app config, ...).
 *   - Each BroadcastChannel message carries `{ windowId, clientId, patch }`.
 *     The receiver drops the message when:
 *       - `windowId === getWindowId()` (self-broadcast echo), OR
 *       - `clientId !== getActiveClientId()` (different window identity).
 *     Same-clientId-only filtering means a window bound to device A will not
 *     pick up state from a window bound to device B.
 *   - Remote applications go through `$patch` with a replay guard
 *     (`__cw_replaying`) so the receiver's own `$subscribe` does not echo
 *     the patch back out.
 *   - On the publisher side, only mutations are observed (not the deep watch)
 *     so unrelated state changes don't spam the channel.
 *
 * Works in both web tabs (same origin BroadcastChannel) and Tauri webviews
 * (same origin within the app process). No platform branching in this file.
